# Mapo Tofu Recipe

## Ingredients
- **100g** ground pork (or skip for vegetarian version)
- **2 teaspoons** Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
- **1 teaspoon** soy sauce
- small knob of ginger, minced
- **1 teaspoon** cornstarch
- **3 teaspoons** of Sichuan peppercorns
- **1 teaspoon** neutral oil
- **3 tablespoons** Doubanjiang (Chinese spicy fermented bean paste)
- **400g** tofu
- **2.5 dl** of chicken stock or water
- chili oil (to taste)
- **1/4 teaspoon** five-spice powder (optional, skipping won't make a huge difference)
- **1 teaspoon** sugar

## Instructions

1. Combine ground pork, Shaoxing wine, soy sauce and ginger in a bowl. Mix together and set aside to marinate.
2. Heat oil in a large pan to medium-high heat. Add sichuan peppercorns when oil is already somewhat hot and cook to infuse the oil. Scoop out the peppers when they start to darken but before burning. (Optional: put them aside to cool, then crush them and use as garnishing in the end.)
3. Add marinated ground meat and doubanjiang. Mix them together and cook until pork is cooked through
4. Add the tofu on top of the pork and add sugar and five-spice. Cover with broth and cook to simmer. Simmer uncovered for ~10 minutes until sauce has reduced to desired consistency. Adjust seasoning to taste. If necessary, create a cornstarch slurry and mix in the sauce to help thicken it.
5. Serve with rice.
